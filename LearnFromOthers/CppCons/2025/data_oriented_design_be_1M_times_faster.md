## Theory

### **Classic DoD + Polya Structure + Heuristics**

* **Classic DoD**: Understand the data => understand the problem
* **Polya**: Structured problem solving => the how to
* **Process**: Understand => plan => execute => reflect
* **Heuristics**: (Activities) to work on the problem: e.g. decomposition
* **Diagnostics**: common failure modes
* **Signs of progress**: simplifications, invariant constraints, beneficial results on the way to solving. Whole condition.
* **Your takeaway**: more places to attack performance and concrete tools/checklists to do it

### **DOD Mike Acton**

* Programs just transform data from one form to another
* Understand the problem by understanding the data
* Understand the cost to understand the problem
* Understand the hardware => understand cost
* Code is data

### **Data-Oriented Design Principles**

* **CONTEXT** the more you have the better you can make your solution
* Software is a real thing running on real hardware
* Reason must prevail (evidence)
* Don't solve problems you don't have
