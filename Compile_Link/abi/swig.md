## What is

SWIG is a software development tool that simplifies the task of interfacing different languages to C and C++ programs. In a nutshell, SWIG is a compiler that takes C/C++ declarations and creates the wrappers needed to access those declarations from other languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java. SWIG normally requires no modifications to existing code and can often be used to build a usable interface in only a few minutes. Possible applications of SWIG include:

* Building interpreted interfaces to existing C programs.
* Rapid prototyping and application development.
* Interactive debugging.
* Reengineering or refactoring of legacy software into scripting language components.
* Making a graphical user interface (using Tk for example).
* Testing of C libraries and programs (using scripts).
* Building high performance C modules for scripting languages.
* Making C programming more enjoyable (or tolerable depending on your point of view).
* Impressing your friends.
* Obtaining vast sums of research funding (although obviously not applicable to the author).
